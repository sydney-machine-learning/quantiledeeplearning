# quantiledeeplearning
Quantile Deep learning models for multi-step ahead time series prediction.

Please note that this project is in progress and workspace environment may change drastically. Python notebook files will be replaced by polished python files in the near future. Please stay tuned!

Currently, there exists the following files & directories:

1. `Data Understanding & Visualisation.ipynb`

Data Exploration and visualisation of crypto dataset(s). 

2. `Very Simple Quantile Regression NN.ipynb`

A workable notebook involving some dataset (Bitcoin), very basic neural network and produces a plot along with some quantile. Note that the code is very raw and no optimisation has been attempted yet.

3. `data`

Directory containing crypto (Bitcoin, Ethereum) data. May have more datasets in the future (Sunspot, Mackey-Glass and Lorenz).

4. `images`

Directory which will contain images generated by python files. When converting notebook file to python, images will be saved here instead of displaying as output in notebook.
